                <h2>kashmir</h2>
                <p>Jammu & Kashmir is a newly created Union Territory in India consisting of two divisions:Jammu
                    Division &
                    Kashmir Division, both of which are administered by the Central Government of India. It is located
                    to
                    the north of Himachal Pradesh & Punjab and to the west of Ladakh. Jammu is known as the City of
                    Temples
                    & offers plentiful sightseeing opportunities with its gardens, palaces, forts & religious
                    attractions,
                    the most famous of which is Mata Vaishno Devi in Katra. Kashmir Valley is famous for its meadows,
                    lakes,
                    high altitude passes, hill stations, Mughal Gardens, Dal Lake, Shikara Ride & ancient religious
                    sites.
                </p>
                <p>There are three valleys in Kashmir region, namely Kashmir, Gurez and Lolab. The Kashmir valley is in
                    the
                    shape of a bowl and it has ten districts. It has people who are called Kashmiri and Gujar. The Gurez
                    valley has population called Sheena and Lolab valley has Kashmiri and Pahadi population. It is
                    interesting to note that Gurez valley in Bandipura district, is spread over about 2000 sq. km. and
                    it
                    has no cultural connect with Kashmir valley because it was part of the Gilgit region, illegally
                    occupied
                    by Pakistan since 1947.

                    <h2>kashmir</h2>
                    <p> Kashmir is a region situated between India and Pakistan in South Asia. It is believed that the
                        name
                        Kashmir originated from the word ‘Ka’ which means water, and ‘shimera’ to desiccate.

                        The story of Kashmir is complex and has historical, cultural, and political dimensions. Over the
                        years, many rulers and empires, like the Mauryas, Kushans, and Mughals have influenced the
                        paradise
                        of the Earth.

                    <h2>history </h2>
                    <p>The history of Jammu and Kashmir is intricately linked to the broader narrative of India’s
                        struggle
                        for independence and the partition of British India in 1947. The controversial accession of the
                        princely state to India led to the first Indo-Pak war and subsequent conflicts over the disputed
                        territory. The signing of the Simla Agreement in 1972 aimed to establish peaceful relations
                        between
                        India and Pakistan.
