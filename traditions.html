                        dance which even attracts the tourists to join in on the excitement. Throughout the region
                        of Kashmir, a wide range of dance forms can be witnessed that are executed based upon the
                        occasion that they mark, for instance, a prominent dance form here is the infamous Mask
                        dance that is executed on the occasion of the Hemis Festival, a popular festival of Kashmir.
                        Another allure of these dances is the bright and vibrant attire paired off with truly

                        Hafiza, Kud, and Bacha Nagma. The folk music of Kashmir will force anyone to start tapping

                        quite prevalent in Kashmir and therefore common melodies that can be heard are the Sitar,
                        Dumru, and Nagara. Apart from that, the music that accompanies festive occasions such as
                        celebrations, parties, and weddings is mainly Wanwun, Ghazals, Choral as well as Sufi.</p>

                    <p>The Jhelum River was the only means of transport initially which resulted in the creation of

                        complex gridwork evolved along the canals and riverfronts.

                        Because the economy of Kashmir is largely dependent on agriculture and the combined
                        activities, the cities, especially Srinagar, never had the wealth to undertake a significant
                        urban reconstruction. Therefore, the image of the towns of Kashmir remains the same as they
                        were 300 years ago, and the wood constructions with roofing are reminiscent of the medieval
                        European towns that live in culture and customs while maintaining the essence of ancient
                        Kashmir for generations.

                        The traditional buildings are of two sorts, based on the plan- square plan and linear plan
                        with windows on both sides, as the symmetry is the main principle for earthquake-resistance
                        structures and the arrangement of the function within. Each residence has a Zoon Dub or a
                        roof-top balcony to view the moon (zoon). The balconies and wing panels are designed like
                        jhumkas and have magnificent Pinjera Kari works. The roofs of interiors have khatamband
                        woodwork, faux ceilings with intertwined geometric shapes of Persian arts and consist of
                        walnuts or deodars with apparent carpentry.

                        much of Gilgit-Baltistan Khowar is spoken.

                        The most diverse groups of languages are the Pahari languages spoken throughout the entire
                        J&K region. Pahari is a collective name given by outsiders because speakers of these
                        languages are generally located in largely hilly parts of the country. These languages are
                        locally known by a variety of dialects. Bhaderwahi, Padri, Ponchi, Mirpuri, Parmi or Pahari
                        (Karnah) are several different Pahari languages.

                        Tibetan languages are languages that belong to the Sino-Tibetan family. J&K speaks many
                        Tibetan languages and falls within the Balti-Ladakhi category or the ancient western
                        Tibetan. Ladakhi or Bhoti or Bodhi, Balti, Purgi and Zangskari are among these.

                        Dogri has about three million speakers. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in the plains of
                        Jammu or in Duggerdesh, in the J&K region. Jammu city has a Dogra majority, the second
                        biggest city in the whole of J&K. Unfortunately, the language has declined considerably
                        despite its official position.

                        Two languages of the Iranian language family, Pashto and Wakhi (Gilgit-Baltistan), are
                        spoken in J&K.

                        In scattered areas, Gojri is spoken across J&K. It’s mainly spoken by Bakerwals and Gujjar.
                        Many Gujjars, however, do not all speak Gojri as local languages but identify and embrace
                        the Gojri culture.

                        The Kashmir valley and Pakistan governed Kashmir speak and understand Urdu. Urdu was
                        acknowledged in 1889 as J&K’s state and official language. For around three centuries,
                        before Urdu, Persian was Kashmir’s official language. The land, revenue, courts and even
                        FIRs in Urdu are recorded on all official records in Kashmir.

                    <p> Most of the Jammu and Kashmir people are mostly occupied by agriculture. Jammu and Kashmir
                        also are the
                        country’s largest fruit producers, because its soil is highly fertile and compatible with
                        fruit growing,
                        such as apples, apricots, cherries and nuts, almonds and walnuts. The Kashmir valley is the
                        sole
                        saffron-producing location in the country. Most farmers participate both in sericulture and
                        in
                        supplementary revenues. Many people participate in the tourism sector since there are a lot
                        of stunning
                        tourist locations.</p>

                        obviously dominates the Kashmir Valley in terms of the entire population and thus the valley
                        is full of Muslim inhabitants. Besides that, Hinduism and Buddhism also form major parts of
                        Kashmir’s religions. Buddhist adherents live in Jammu and Kashmir’s Ladakh district.</p>
