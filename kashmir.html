                        “If there is a heaven on earth, it is here, it is here, it is here!”- beautifully quoted by
                        Emperor
                        Jahangir
                        on Kashmir back in the 17th century, this quote still holds true almost 4 centuries later.

                        Right from its picturesque mountains, dense forests, green meadows, gushing rivers, and lakes to
                        its
                        warm
                        and hospitable people- everything about Kashmir is supremely beautiful.

                        From being the royal retreat of the Mughals to being high-up on every traveller’s list, the
                        beauty
                        of
                        Kashmir has stood in its magnificent glory even in the most uncertain times.

                        But, what makes Kashmir so unarguably beautiful that innumerable poets, authors, filmmakers, and
                        artists
                        around the world have dedicated their pieces of work to this land of paradise? Let’s find out!

            <div class="landscape">

                        Jammu and Kashmir is an exceptionally beautiful place. The landscape of this place is simply out
                        of
                        this world and that is why it has been referred to as the Paradise on Earth.

                        Lying between the Great Himalayan range and the Pir Panjal mountain range, Kashmir offers a wide
                        variety of interesting places for sightseeing. The union territory stands to the north Himachal
                        Pradesh and Punjab and to the west of Ladakh.



                        Major part of the landscape of Kashmir is mountainous. The mountains in Kashmir are categorised
                        as
                        Alpine and Himalayan. Some of the world’s highest peaks are located in the union territory. The
                        region between Karakoram and Zanskar mountains forms Ladakh. Drass located near the Kargil city
                        is
                        the coldest place in India and said to be the coldest inhabited place of the world after
                        Siberia.

                        Kashmir is sure to leave you awestruck. Kashmir is abound with rich flora. You will find the
                        magnificently large Chinar tree throughout the valley, a tree not very commonly found
                        everywhere.
                        This
                        stunning color-changing tree is at the peak of its utmost beauty at the onset of autumn, making
                        the
                        already gorgeous Kashmir look like something straight out of a storybook.

                        Go a little further into the mountains and you’ll find dense forests lined with deodar, fir,
                        pine,
                        and
                        cedar trees. Come spring and the tulips here are in full bloom. The many fields here in Kashmir
                        lined
                        with colorful tulips are sure to make your stop and stare. The lush green and flowery meadows
                        are
                        sure
                        to take your heart away too!

                        We could go on and on about the resplendent nature of Kashmir, but to experience it for
                        yourself,
                        you
                        must come here at least once.

                        The land of Kashmir is home to numerous water bodies. There is nothing quite as calming as
                        sitting
                        by a
                        lake or river and just getting lost in nature’s bounty. No matter where you go in Kashmir, you
                        are
                        sure
                        to come across many pristine lakes, glaciers and rivers.

                        A shikara ride on the Dal lake in Srinagar is a complete experience in itself. Watching the
                        floating
                        gardens and markets will mesmerize you. The Wular lake is yet another famous lake near Srinagar.
                        The
                        Mansar and Surinsar lakes are the perfect places to spend some time relaxing and rejuvenating.
                        Gadsar
                        lake in Sonmarg is a hidden gem that can only be reached through a trek. Similarly, the
                        Mansalbal
                        lake
                        in the Ganderbal district is a bird lover’s paradise.

                        Rivers like the Sindh or Indus, Lidder river, Zanskar river, and many others beautify the
                        landscape
                        of
                        Kashmir multi-folds.

                        Every lake and river offers an altogether different view and each one is sure to take your
                        breath
                        away.

                        Srinagar are some of the top ones here. These verdant valleys are surrounded by mountains and
                        abound
                        with lakes, waterfalls, and numerous trees and meadows. The natural beauty of Kashmir is at its
                        peak
                        here and will astound you in every way.
                        The valley is surrounded by ranges of the Himalayas, bounded on the southwest by the Pir Panjal
                        Range and on the northeast by the Greater Himalayan range. It is approximately 135 km (84 mi)
                        long
                        and 32 km (20 mi) wide, and drained by the Jhelum River.[2] It covers the entire area of the

                        The beauty of Kashmir isn’t just limited to its surroundings but is also deeply rooted in its
                        rich
                        culture and history. Over the years, Kashmir has been ruled and loved by various rulers. So, its
                        culture
                        is a diverse blend influenced by various other cultures.

                        And it is prevalent in the day-to-day life of the Kashmiris. Kashmir’s rich history is prevalent
                        in
                        its
                        various historic monuments like the Pari Mahal, Shalimar Bagh, Avantipur temples, and Leh
                        Palace.
                        These
                        monuments tell a story of an era gone long by and are pretty interesting places, especially for
                        history
                        enthusiasts.

                        Another thing that is deeply rooted in Kashmiri culture is the art of handicraft making. Kashmir
                        is
                        quite popular for its handicrafts right from the Pashmina shawl, carpets to paper mache and wood
                        carving. When talking about Kashmir’s beauty, we just simply cannot ignore its rich culture and
                        heritage.

                        Even on the harshest of summer days, Kashmir has pretty soothing weather. So, where temperature
                        rises
                        over 40 degrees celsius in the rest of the country, Kashmir is the perfect place to visit. The
                        early
                        winter is also a great time to visit Kashmir for an incredible snowy experience.

                        Kashmir basically turns into a wonderland as the winter season sets in. The snow-capped
                        mountains
                        and
                        white surroundings are quite a sight to behold. The autumn season here is quite charming too. As
                        the
                        trees change their colors and the weather turns pleasant, Kashmir in autumn looks as pretty as a
                        picture.
                        The climate of Kashmir fixes the activities to be done in every season. Thus, there will be
                        various
                        seasons such as snow sports to summer trekking and autumn photography to do specific things

                        The beauty of a place cannot be complete without its warm and friendly locals. And the same goes
                        for
                        Kashmir too. As soon as you set foot on this paradisiacal land, the warm people here will
                        welcome
                        you
                        with open arms.
                        The people of Kashmir are believed to be the descendants of the immigrants from India proper. As
                        Buddhism spread here, people from far and wide came for research and study. People of Kashmir
                        experience a culture that is an amalgamation of a number of other cultures they came in contact
                        with. Roman, Greek and Persian civilizations have influenced the culture of Kashmiri people to
                        quite
                        an extent. Kashmiri population is a blend of people belonging to distinct races with different
                        looks, dresses, food habits, customs, traditions, rituals, etc. Have a look at the people and
                        main
                        ethnic groups in Jammu and Kashmir.
