            <p class="f">
                Kashmir offers truly delicious cuisine that includes both vegetarian and non-vegetarian
                delicacies for this is a place that caters to all and these delicious dishes will leave you
                wanting more. Some infamous non-vegetarian dishes are the Kashmiri Kebab, Pasanda, Syun Alu,
                Yakhni, and Methi Keema and therefore it’s every meat-lover’s delight. But vegetarians need not
                worry because there are myriad dishes available for them, such as Rajmah, Shree Pulao, Ladyar
                Tsaman, and Nadir Yakhaen. These flavorful dishes are prepared by utilizing fresh vegetables and
                paneer, to make it all the more delicious. Kashmir is an amazing destination for anyone like me
                who loves desserts. You absolutely must try out delicacies such as sevaiyaan, phirni, barfi,
                Kashmiri Aloo Dum and many more that will truly make your day. Kashmiris are known for their

                that is a staple to the household of Kashmir is its very own pulao. Additionally, Hak or Karam
                is a dish that is a favorite in the region and is specially prepared during cold winter evenings
                to provide warmth.

            <h3>1. Kahwa </h3>
            <div class="kahwa">
                <div class="food-para">
                    <p>Kahwa is a primitive beverage of Kashmir, and the mere mention of the name of Kahwa reminds
                        people of the hills and beauty of Kashmir. Every traditional Kashmiri household welcomes its
                        guests with a warm cup of Kahwa.
                        <br><br>
                        Kahwa is a unique take on green tea. The Kashmiris cannot imagine their lives without a warm cup
                        of Kahwa. The drink is straightforward to prepare, and Kashmiri green tea leaves, cardamom and
                        cinnamon powder, saffron, and crudely ground almonds are Kahwa’s essential ingredients. The
                        glass has revitalizing qualities with its tasteful ingredients. Kashmiri gatherings are
                        incomplete without a warm cup of Kahwa.

            <h3>2.mutton rogan josh</h3>
            <div class="rogan">
                <div class="food-para">
                    <p>Mutton Rogan Josh is a fiery red spicy Kashmiri-style mutton curry. It has a thin
                        red-colored gravy
                        and a thick layer of fat (rogan) floating on top.

                        It is a curry of Persian origin brought to Kashmiri by the Mughals.<br><br>

                        The characteristic red color of rogan josh comes from using a liberal amount of Kashmiri red
                        chili
                        powder and a unique Kashmiri spice called ratan jot.

                        This curry can be made without onions and garlic like the Kashmiri Pandits do or with onions and
                        garlic in the Kashmiri Muslim style.<br>

                        Most often, the rogan josh curry you get in restaurants worldwide is not even remotely close to
                        the
                        authentic recipe. They make a regular onion-tomato-based mutton curry and call it Rogan Josh.

                        So don’t be fooled by that taste. Learn to make this curry authentically using my easy recipe.
                        It
                        tastes delicious, too.

                        Kashmiri rogan josh tastes best with steamed Basmati rice. You can also serve it with Indian
                        bread,
                        such as Plain Naan, Tandoori Roti, Phulka, or Lachha Paratha.
