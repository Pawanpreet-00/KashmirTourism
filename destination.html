                <p>Kashmir tourism has been described as a paradise so many times that one feels it is the ultimate
                    homage
                    you could pay to it. But somehow, there is a vagueness in it which does not do justice to this part
                    of
                    the country. This region has a complicated history, and its stunning scenery and cultural diversity
                    make
                    it a one-of-a-kind and enthralling destination. Jammu & Kashmir lies in India’s far north and shares
                    international borders with Pakistan and China.<br><br>

                    What is paradise in Jammu & Kashmir? Jammu and Kashmir, also known as the “Crown of India,” is a
                    northern Indian union territory with a rich and diversified cultural past. It is noted for its
                    breathtaking natural beauty, with views ranging from lush valleys and calm lakes to hilly mountains
                    and
                    high-altitude desert regions. It is its alpine meadows, crystal clear lakes, amber hues of the trees
                    during autumn, boathouses, gondolas, apple orchards and everything else that add to its landscape.
                    Jammu
                    and Kashmir’s cuisine is diverse and rich. It contains foods such as Rogan Josh, Gushtaba, Yakhni,
                    and a
                    variety of breads such as Sheermal and Lavasa. The area is also famed for its kebabs and the Wazwan
                    feast.</p>

                        committee
                        in the

                        Gulmarg very well justifies its name, the meadows of flowers, and you will come across a lot of
                        meadows decorated with daisies. A beautiful aspect of the meadow is the 1890s Anglican Church of

                        highest
                        cable car project. Gulmarg has also grown as one of the best adventure destinations, with the

                        skiing and snowboarding courses and facilities. Gulmarg, known for its scenic splendour, has
                        also

                        climate
                        with considerable snowfall throughout the wet winter season, which is unusual for its latitude.

                    <p>Yusmarg is a hill station in the western part of the valley of Kashmir. The Ahmadiyya Muslim
                        community believes it to be the place where Jesus once lived. Yusmarg translates as ‘The Meadow
                        of
                        Jesus’ in Kashmiri. A marg means a meadow, and the term ‘Yus’ is considered to be a short form
                        of
                        Youza or Jesus. It can also be referred to as Switzerland and is 47 kilometres away from
                        Srinagar.
                        The landscape here is more beautiful than anything you will ever see. Yusmarg, the imperial gem
                        of
                        the Bagdam district, is home to several picturesque locations. It enchants visitors with its
                        natural
                        beauty in sites such as Sang-e-Safed Valley; Yusmarg is also known for having some exceptional
                        flower springs.<br><br>

                        Tattakutti (4,725 m) and Sunset Peak (4,746 m) are two of the highest peaks in the PirPanjal
                        range.
                        Yusmarg’s huge natural slopes offer skiing chances to adventure seekers. On the other hand, the
                        holy
                        shrine of Charar-e-Sharif is said to bless the entire region and safeguard the land from all
                        types
                        of misfortunes. Yusmarg’s ageless beauty captivates tourists’ hearts and inspires them to return
                        again and again.<br><br>

                        riding
                        here. Yusmarg is considered the most serene location among all the tourist attractions in
                        Kashmir
                        and a fantastic place to go trekking as it offers forests with maple trees for people who want

                    <p> Sonamarg is a beautiful hill station in Jammu and Kashmir, approximately 80 kilometres north of
                        Srinagar. It is at a height of approximately 2,730 metres above sea level, on the bank of the
                        flowing
                        Sindh River. Sonmarg means a “meadow of gold”, and is one of the best tourist places in Jammu
                        and
                        Kashmir for sightseeing & adventure. Its landscape is marked by a glacier, forests and
                        snow-capped
                        mountains. The town is located in Jammu and Kashmir’s Ganderbal district, about 70 km from
                        Srinagar
                        International Airport. It was also the starting point for the Silk Road, which linked Kashmir to
                        China.<br><br>

                        This mountain is surrounded by the big Himalayan glaciers Kolahoi Glacier and Machoi Glacier,
                        and it
                        is
                        the source of the famed Three Sisters of Kashmir Valley. The three Great Lakes in
                        Kashmir:<br><br>
                        Kishansar,
                        Vishansar and Gadsar, can be visited from here. Peaks such as Kolahoi Peak, Amarnath Peak,
                        Machoi
                        Peak,
                        and Sirbal Peak tower over this lovely hill town, making Songamarg a renowned destination for
                        adventure
                        sports tourism. The Thajiwas range divides the Sonmarg Valley into two halves; on one side lies
                        the
                        fir-covered Thajiwas spur, which is popular for camping. The Thajiwas glacier, which is the main
                        attraction of this place, is located on the other side.<br><br>

                        Camping & trout fishing are some popular adventure activities. Sonmarg is also the starting
                        point
                        for
                        the trek to Amarnath Cave, a major Hindu pilgrimage destination. However, in the winter,
                        Sonamarg is
                        inaccessible because of avalanches and heavy snowfall that shut the NH1D, which connects it to
                        neighbouring locations. Except for the winter months (November to February), the climate in the
                        area
                        is
                        normally suitable for tourism. It is best to visit flowery meadows between April and October to
                        fully
                        appreciate their splendour.<br><br>

                        As a result, the valley was renamed Betaab Valley. It is a visual treat with its meadows,

                    <p>The Gurez Valley is a stunning natural location in Jammu and Kashmir, located in the high

                        around 86 kilometres (53 miles) north of Srinagar and 123 kilometres (76 miles) south of
                        Bandipore.
                        Gurez Valley is situated at an elevation of 2400 metres above sea level and the weather is
                        always
                        nice here. The area is ideal for photography, tranquil picnics, and hiking adventures. The
                        picturesque valley is surrounded by snow-capped mountains, meadows clothed with lindens, walnut
                        and
                        willow trees and the raging river KishanGanga. Dawar and Tilel are the two districts that make
                        up
                        the Gurez Valley. Dawar is also Gurez’s central settlement, and it is where all of the hotels
                        are
                        located.<br><br>

                        Due to substantial snowfall of about 2 metres (7 ft) and the closure of Razdan Pass in winter,
                        the
                        Gurez Valley is cut off from the rest of the world for six months and also enhances its appeal
                        as a
                        famous tourist destination in Jammu and Kashmir. The people who live here are one of the oldest
                        tribes in Kashmir called the Dard Shin Tribe and speak a language called Shina. Villages are
                        also
                        spread across the valley, providing tourists with a glimpse into the tough yet peaceful lives of
                        the
                        residents.<br><br>

                        Visitors can ride the Gurez helicopter operated by the Gurez Copter Service to see the valley
                        from a
                        whole different perspective. Given its altitude, the valley is expected to be colder than other
                        places. Pack a warm jacket, gloves, and extra clothing to keep yourself warm in windy
                        conditions,
                        especially at night. The network is difficult to discover here, and companies such as Airtel and
                        JIO
                        may not work at all. BSNL is one of the few service providers that provides some services, but

                    <p>verinag is a town in the district of Anantnag, where the Verinag Spring is a must-see attraction.
                        Verinag is a town named after the Verinag spring and the Mughal garden. Verinag, on the route to
                        Jammu, is a spring of great importance and beauty, with deep blue water that emerges from the
                        bottom
                        of a high scarp of a mountain spur, and this stone basin & arcade surrounding were built by
                        Jahangir. This spring is well-known for never drying up or overflowing.<br><br>

                        Emperor Jahangir constructed an octagonal pavement around the spring. The Emperor was so taken
                        with
                        the beauty of Verinag that when he died at Chengas village near Rajouri, he requested to be
                        buried
                        there. And after finishing the design for the spring and the adjoining garden, he said that the
                        traveller who travelled around the world can rarely give any example of another site of such
                        beauty.<br><br>

                        At this location, a tourist bungalow, a rest house, and some shelters have been built. A Mughal
                        Garden also stands right in front of this spring. The beautiful garden next to it was built by
                        Shah
                        Jahan. This tourist resort is located in Tehsil Shahabad Bala, approximately 26 kilometres from
                        Anantnag Town. The spring is the main source of the River Jhelum. The Archaeological Survey of
                        India
                        has designated Verinag Spring and the Mughal Arcade surrounding it as a Monument of National
                        Importance.<br><br>

                        According to folklore, goddess Vitasta (Jhelum) planned to take her rise from here, but when she
                        arrived, Shiva was already here, so she had to return and take her rise from Veravurthur, a
                        spring
                        approximately one mile to the north-west of this location. Virah means ‘to return’ in Sanskrit,
                        and
                        nag signifies a water spring, therefore because Vitasta had to return from this location, it
                        became
                        known as Virahnag or “Vernag.”<br><br>

                    <p>Srinagar finds a place on this list because it is one of the most famous tourist destinations in
                        Jammu and Kashmir as well as the top honeymoon destination. Srinagar, often referred to as
                        “Heaven
                        on Earth,” is located in the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir, on the banks of the Jhelum
                        River
                        between the Hari Parbat and Shankaracharya hills. Srinagar is notable for its stationary
                        houseboats
                        and gondola-style rowboats known as Shikaras in Dal Lake. It is Jammu and Kashmir’s largest city
                        and
                        summer capital.<br><br>

                        The presence of many Mughal Gardens, religious & historical sites as well as Dal & Nigeen Lakes
                        has
                        led Srinagar to being called the “Land of Gardens and Lakes.” Among the other things that will
                        surprise you, is the floating vegetable market on Dal Lake. Shikaras are used by tourists to
                        visit
                        sites such as the Floating Vegetable Market and the Mir Bahris, a vibrant community of people
                        who
                        live on the lakeside itself. Several houseboats on the lake offer a wonderful and unique stay
                        experience. Srinagar is home to some of India’s most beautiful Mughal-era gardens, including
                        Nishat
                        Bagh, Shalimar Bagh, and Chashm-e-Shahi Garden. The largest Tulip gardens in Asia are also in
                        Srinagar.<br><br>

                        Kashmiri food, also known as Wazwan, is well-known around the world. When in Srinagar, taste the
                        traditional delicacies, which are rich in typical fragrant spices. Srinagar is also known for
                        its
                        Kashmiri shawls, Kashmiri apples, and dried fruits (almonds and walnuts) at the Lal Chowk
                        Market.

                        During the winter months of December to February, heavy snowfall affects Srinagar’s connection.
                        Communal conflicts often result in frequent curfews in some areas of the city; however, things
                        have

                        and
                        also a major Hindu pilgrimage destination in India. The temple stands on the Trikuta Hills,13
                        kilometres from Katra (in Jammu and Kashmir’s union territory). The Mother Goddess, who is the
                        main
                        deity, is believed to fulfil the wishes of her devotees. Vaishno Devi, also known as Mata Rani,
                        Vaishnavi, and Trikuta, is an embodiment of the Hindu Goddess Durga. Goddesses are believed to
                        arrive at the Holy Cave during the pooja and aarti to pay their respects to Mata Rani. Vaishno
                        Devi
                        is known as Moonh Maangi Muradein Poori Karne Wali Mata (the mother who grants her children’s
                        requests). This sacred site is regarded as the most important Shaktipeeth since it is believed
                        that
                        the Goddess Sati’s skull fell here.<br><br>

                        Maa Vaishno Devi’s darshan in the holy cave takes the shape of three naturally formed rocks
                        known as
                        pindies. The goddess is represented by these pindies in three different forms: Maha Kali, Maha
                        Saraswati, and Maha Lakshmi. Interestingly, although sharing the same source rock, all of the
                        pindies varied in colour and texture. The delicate white rock on the extreme left is believed to
                        be
                        the Goddess Saraswati, the yellow-red rock in the middle represents Goddess Lakshmi and the
                        black
                        rock on the left represents Goddess Kali. The Pandavas of the epic Mahabharata were believed to
                        have
                        built the sacred cave temple. Every year, almost a million individuals visit the Vaishno Devi
                        temple.<br><br>

                        including musk deer and Himalayan black and brown bear. Kishtwar is unique due to its wide range
                        of
                        flora and animals, even though it is not the only high-altitude wildlife sanctuary.
                        A vacation in Kishtwar will also provide you with lots of sightseeing options, with the most
                        popular
